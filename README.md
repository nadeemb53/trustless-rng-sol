## Trustless Random Number Generation

This repository contains the Solidity contracts for a decentralized protocol for generating verifiably random numbers. The protocol is based on the research paper [Dynamic User Entropy](https://www.ontropy.io/math_whitepaper.pdf) and is intended for use in multiplayer games that require a fair and secure method of generating random numbers.

### Contracts

- DKG.sol: Contains the contract for the Distributed Key Generation (DKG) process

- ElGamal.sol: Contains the contract for the ElGamal encryption process
